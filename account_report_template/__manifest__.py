    This is a module doing the same things as the official Odoo module for accounting reports, but the inner working is
    completely different (the authors have never seen the code of the closed-source module).
    It depends on the generic table_report module (https://github.com/unamur-dev/odoo-tools).

    THIS IS AN ALPHA VERSION. All feedback is welcome. It should be all finished and tested by September.
